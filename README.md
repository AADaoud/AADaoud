### **ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Abdullah**  
I'm a **Computer Engineering student at KoÃ§ University** who loves to build, break, and optimize things. I work on many things but **automation/AI/Data-mining** are what I do professionally (for now), naturally Iâ€™m always exploring new technologies and expanding my skill set!  

I enjoy solving real-world problems, streamlining workflows, and figuring out how to make systems more efficient. If it involves **code, data, or automation**, Iâ€™m probably interested.
